**Change Request: CR‑106 – Clinical “Guided Mode” for Therapists/Coaches Using H3LIX**

---

## 1. Objective

Add a **clinically‑oriented guided mode** on top of CR‑101–105 so licensed therapists/coaches can:

1. Use H3LIX/LAIZA as a **co‑pilot in live sessions**, grounded in the SORK‑N loop (S → O → R → K → N → S′) rather than as an autonomous decision‑maker.  [oai_citation:0‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
2. Co‑construct and refine a client’s **MPG‑based case formulation** (segments, pathways, RVs) using evidence from sessions + daily life streams.  [oai_citation:1‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
3. Run **guided interventions** (behavioral experiments, exposure tasks, decision coaching) while monitoring Somatic, Symbolic, and Noetic coherence in a safe, auditable way.  [oai_citation:2‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

> **Important**: H3LIX remains a *supportive tool*. Clinical judgment, diagnosis, and treatment decisions stay with the human professional.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- Clinical “guided mode” built into:
  - **Clinician Console** (CR‑105) – new “Session” workspace.  
  - **Participant cockpit / KMP app** (CR‑104) – client‑facing tasks & check‑ins.
- Data model extensions for:
  - `:ClinicalSession`, `:ClinicalEpisode`, `:ClinicalNote`, `:InterventionPlan`.
- Real‑time **session dashboards**:
  - Smoothed somatic state ŝ(t), coherence indicators C(t), and MPG snippets, all at **low resolution**, not raw data.  [oai_citation:3‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
- Guided workflows for:
  - SORK‑N‑style case formulation,
  - setting/monitoring interventions,
  - reviewing MPG‑Intuition episodes with clients.

### Out of scope

- Automated diagnosis, medication recommendations, or crisis triage.  
- Replacing formal clinical record systems / EMR (we provide export hooks, not full EMR).  
- Any use without appropriate **ethics/IRB + clinical governance**.

---

## 3. Clinical session model (how H3LIX fits therapy)

We explicitly ground guided mode in:

- **SORK model** from behavior therapy (Stimulus–Organism–Response–Kontingenz) extended to SORK‑N (Noetic) by H3LIX.  [oai_citation:4‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
- **MPG** as the structured case formulation: nodes = traits, routines, stressors, coping, etc.; segments = higher‑order patterns; pathways = “routes of influence”.  [oai_citation:5‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

Each **ClinicalSession** is one or more SORK‑N cycles:

1. **S – Stimulus:** in‑session events (topics, exposures, tasks) + live Somatic signals.  
2. **O – Organism:** client’s beliefs, interpretations, emotions → MPG updates via Symbolic layer.  [oai_citation:6‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
3. **R – Response:** behavioral choices during/after session.  
4. **K – Kontingenz/Consequence:** what happens next, self‑report & external outcomes.  [oai_citation:7‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
5. **N – Noetic:** coherence estimation; cross‑signal alignment and anomalies.  [oai_citation:8‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
6. **S′ – Write‑back:** H3LIX suggests updated focus/thresholds or candidate interventions for *next* session or homework.

Guided mode surfaces just enough structure and metrics for the clinician to reason about this loop without drowning in details.

---

## 4. Schema extensions (Neo4j)

### 4.1 Core clinical entities

New labels:

- `:ClinicalSession`
- `:ClinicalEpisode` (e.g., a specific discussion, exposure, or exercise within a session)
- `:ClinicalNote`
- `:InterventionPlan`

Constraints:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT clinical_session_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:ClinicalSession) REQUIRE c.id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT clinical_episode_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (e:ClinicalEpisode) REQUIRE e.id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT clinical_note_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n:ClinicalNote) REQUIRE n.id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT intervention_plan_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:InterventionPlan) REQUIRE p.id IS UNIQUE;
```

Relationships:

```text
(:Participant)-[:HAS_CLINICAL_SESSION]->(:ClinicalSession)
(:Clinician)-[:CONDUCTS_SESSION]->(:ClinicalSession)

(:ClinicalSession)-[:HAS_EPISODE]->(:ClinicalEpisode)
(:ClinicalEpisode)-[:LINKS_TRIAL]->(:Trial)          // optional, for formal tasks
(:ClinicalEpisode)-[:FOCUSES_SEGMENT]->(:Segment)    // case formulation focus

(:ClinicalSession)-[:HAS_NOTE]->(:ClinicalNote)
(:ClinicalSession)-[:USES_PLAN]->(:InterventionPlan)
(:InterventionPlan)-[:TARGETS_SEGMENT]->(:Segment)
(:InterventionPlan)-[:TRACKS_TRIAL]->(:Trial)
```

Basic properties for `:ClinicalSession`:

```text
id, participant_id, clinician_id,
start_time, end_time,
mode: "IN_PERSON" | "TELEHEALTH",
session_number:int,
goals: [string],
status: "PLANNED" | "ONGOING" | "COMPLETED"
```

## 5. Guided workflows

### 5.1 Pre‑session “formulation snapshot”

When scheduling/starting a ClinicalSession:

- Backend generates a **Formulation Snapshot** for the participant:

  - Top N segments by importance & confidence (case‑relevant clusters).  [oai_citation:9‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
  - Flagged **Rogue Variables** (RVs) with high Potency.  [oai_citation:10‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
  - Recent **Noetic coherence** trends (C(t) over last days).  [oai_citation:11‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
  - Recent **MPG‑Intuition episodes**: intuitive trials, MUFS presence, performance.  [oai_citation:12‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

Clinician console shows this as:

- “Working formulation” card: 3–5 key segments with plain‑language summaries.  
- “Watchlist”: RV segments/pathways with Potency index & short rationale.  [oai_citation:13‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

Clinician can:

- Mark some as **Focus for this session** (creates `:ClinicalEpisode` placeholders).  
- De‑emphasize others (temporary hide flag; doesn’t delete from MPG).

### 5.2 In‑session view (live co‑pilot)

During a ClinicalSession:

- Streams (from KMP app / telehealth capture) → Somatic & Symbolic processors in near real‑time.  [oai_citation:14‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
- Clinician UI shows:

  - **Smoothed arousal** curve (e.g., HRV or composite) over last minutes.  
  - Simple **coherence indicator** (e.g., low/medium/high) updated every 10–30s, based on Noetic layer.  [oai_citation:15‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
  - “Active segments” list:
    - which key MPG segments have strong evidence or RV contributions in this time window.  [oai_citation:16‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

No raw text or audio is auto‑transcribed for the clinician UI unless explicitly enabled; we focus on **derived structure**.

H3LIX may suggest:

- “It looks like the ‘Work conflict’ segment is active; consider exploring contingencies here.”  
- “Coherence is dropping while discussing Topic X; might be a good place to slow down / ground.”

Therapist **chooses** whether to act; the system never interrupts the session on its own.

### 5.3 Guided case formulation editor

Inside a session or offline, clinicians can:

- For a chosen segment (e.g., “Social anxiety in meetings”):

  - View simplified SORK map:
    - S: common triggers (derived from MPG events & calendar/email/meeting context).  [oai_citation:17‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  
    - O: beliefs & interpretations nodes (negative predictions, safety behaviors).  
    - R: behaviors (avoidance, reassurance seeking) from Symbolic traces.  
    - K: consequences (short‑term relief, long‑term cost).  

- Add clinical annotations:
  - diagnostic tags (e.g., “social anxiety”, “burnout”),  
  - hypotheses (“client expects humiliation when speaking up”).

These annotate MPG nodes/segments and are stored as `R(x)` reasoning in the MPG’s provenance fields.  [oai_citation:18‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

### 5.4 Intervention planning & tracking

Using `:InterventionPlan`, clinician defines:

- **Target segments** (e.g., “work meetings avoidance”).  
- Planned interventions:
  - exposures,
  - cognitive restructuring exercises,
  - behavioral activation tasks,
  - decision‑support tasks (MPG‑Intuition experiments adapted to client’s context).

Plan fields:

```text
id, name, type: "EXPOSURE" | "BEHAVIORAL_EXPERIMENT" | "DECISION_TASK" | ...
targets: [Segment.id]
homework_tasks: [MobileTrialConfig-like refs]
intended_duration, start_date, end_date
success_criteria (text)
risk_level: "LOW" | "MEDIUM"
```

These tasks are delivered via **KMP app** as structured trials (CR‑102), with Somatic + Symbolic data flowing back to evaluate effects.

### 5.5 Post‑session review

After each ClinicalSession:

- Console shows:

  - summary of session‑level Somatic & coherence patterns,  
  - MPG segments that shifted (importance, confidence, coherence),  
  - RVs whose Potency changed,  
  - which interventions from `InterventionPlan` were used & outcomes.  [oai_citation:19‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

Clinician writes a **ClinicalNote**:

- narrative summary & interpretation (stored separately from raw data; only ID links to MPG).  

Mirror Core treats this as high‑quality Evidence (`qi` high in Conf calculation).  [oai_citation:20‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

---

## 6. Safety, ethics, and scope of guidance

Guided mode must:

- Never claim diagnostic authority or override clinician judgment.  
- Avoid high‑stakes suggestions (e.g., medication, crisis decisions).  
- Explicitly present outputs as **hypotheses & visualizations**, not facts.

We implement:

1. **Risk‑aware filters**:
   - Segments with high affective load and high Potency (Impact Factors) are flagged; the console presents **warnings** rather than direct intervention suggestions.  [oai_citation:21‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

2. **Clinical override & masking**:
   - Clinicians can mark segments as:
     - “Do not surface in UI” (for now),
     - “Sensitive – see only in aggregated form”.  
   - This updates visibility metadata; MPG still holds structure for research, but front‑end keeps it minimal.

3. **Audit trails**:
   - Every suggestion and clinical action (accept/ignore) is logged as a `:PolicyEpisode` + `:ClinicalNote` link, fulfilling the governance & impact accounting role of RVs.  [oai_citation:22‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

4. **Explicit disclaimers**:
   - UI texts clarifying that H3LIX is **assistive**, not a medical device or diagnostic tool; experimental noetic aspects (e.g., pre‑event coherence) are treated cautiously and flagged as exploratory, in line with the paper’s conservative stance on small/noisy psi effects.  [oai_citation:23‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)

## 7. Implementation steps

1. **Schema & RBAC**  
   - Add `:ClinicalSession`, `:ClinicalEpisode`, `:ClinicalNote`, `:InterventionPlan` and relationships.  
   - Create `:Clinician` users and RBAC roles (`clinician`, `researcher`, `admin`).

2. **APIs**  
   - `/clinical/session/start`, `/clinical/session/end`, `/clinical/session/{id}/snapshot`.  
   - `/clinical/intervention_plan/*` CRUD.  
   - `/clinical/mpg_snapshot` (segment, RV, coherence summaries).

3. **Clinician console updates (CR‑105 extension)**  
   - New “Clinical mode” tab:
     - Pre‑session formulation snapshot view.  
     - Live session view (arousal, coherence, active segments).  
     - Post‑session summary & note editor.

4. **KMP app updates (CR‑104 extension)**  
   - “Therapy tasks” area for InterventionPlan homework.  
   - Signals to mark clinical sessions vs everyday use (so Noetic/Somatic align windows correctly).

5. **Mirror Core adaptation**  
   - Tag all SORK‑N cycles initiated in clinical context; route their analytics into ClinicalSession structures as well as general MPG.

6. **Pilot and guardrail testing**  
   - Run internally with mock clients / synthetic data first.  
   - Then small, supervised pilot with real clinicians & participants under ethics approval.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria

CR‑106 is complete when:

1. A clinician can:

   - View a participant’s **formulation snapshot** (segments, RVs, coherence, MPG‑Intuition episodes) before a session.  
   - Run a live session with **basic real‑time Somatic & coherence cues** and segment focus suggestions.  
   - Define an **InterventionPlan** and see its impact over subsequent sessions.

2. Behind the scenes:

   - ClinicalSessions, Episodes, Notes, and InterventionPlans are recorded in Neo4j and linked to MPG, RV, MUFS, and coherence data.  
   - All suggestions and clinician decisions are logged for governance.  [oai_citation:24‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

3. Safety & ethics:

   - No raw PII (email content, full transcripts) is exposed in the console by default; only derived structures.  
   - Clinicians can mute/hide segments and restrict interventions per participant.  
   - UI clearly states that H3LIX is a *support tool* and may surface experimental noetic metrics whose interpretation must be cautious and empirically validated.  [oai_citation:25‡Symbiotic_human_AI_architecture.pdf](sediment://file_000000000db071f49f637b00e8081106)  

4. At least one **complete therapy‑like workflow** has been run in test/pilot:

   - H3LIX helps identify a key MPG segment and RVs,  
   - support planning a behavioral experiment,  
   - track Somatic + coherence changes and structural MPG updates across sessions,  
   - without overriding the clinician or breaching privacy constraints.

---

If you want to keep climbing after CR‑106, a natural **CR‑107** would be about **formal clinical protocols** (e.g., CBT for social anxiety, insomnia; coaching for decision fatigue) encoded as reusable SORK‑N + MPG templates that clinicians can instantiate and H3LIX can track over time.
